## Incoming - emLab server!

-   192 cores
-   1.5GB RAM
-   60TB onboard high-speed storage
-   Use options will include interactive R Studio Server, JupyterHub, optional queue system
-   Server will be physically housed at UCSB and managed by GRIT
-   We will be doing trainings on how to use the server most effectively (e.g., `#emlab-study-club` session on parallel computing on January 9)
-   Expected February or March 2024!

## Data transition from Google Shared Drive to UCSB servers

-   Google is phasing out free unlimited storage
-   We will be transitioning *all* data, media, and non-Google doc files to data storage at UCSB managed by GRIT
-   Data for active projects will be stored on high-speed drives on emLab server; data for archived projects will be on rented slow-speed storage; all data will have a backup copy
-   We will maintain a Google Shared Drive for collaborative Google docs

## Data transition from Google Shared Drive to UCSB servers

-   We will have multiple options for accessing the data:
    -   Directly on the emLab server via R Studio Server or JupyterHub (this will be *fast!*)
    -   On our own laptops/desktops via Nextcloud desktop app, or mounting the drive via Samba
-   Transition of archived projects has already been completed
-   Transtion for active projects to begin in January 2024

## #emLab-study-club (#methods-and-materials-meetup??)
